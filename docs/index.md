##### Why does this exist?
<div style="text-align: justify">
The open legend website is good - for the most part. Ideally, when you click on the section about banes and boons you would want the website to display everything about banes and boons. This is not so. This documentation was created to lump everything about certain subjects together, while still creating the nice flow of the original website.</div>
