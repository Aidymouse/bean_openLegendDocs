# Chapter 1: Character Creation

Before you can start telling your story, you’ll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.

Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.
